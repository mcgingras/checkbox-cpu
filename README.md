# Checkbox CPU

No good reason to be doing this.

To run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Todo:
Performance is starting to be an issue, and I haven't even worked on the ALU yet. Maybe a CLA (carry look-ahead adder) would help improve efficiency here?

Notes:
Something I'm thinking about with this project is how I learned much of this in 3420 at Cornell. Yet, I don't actually remember much aside from the high level details. I'm sure at some point I'll forget what I learned while implementing this project, but it would be cool if somehow this project was self annotating so I could come back and quickly jot my memory. Why is that so difficult?
